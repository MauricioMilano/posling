        <p>Origin of financial resources</p>
        <p>
          <br><strong>1. PROAP</strong><br>
          <br>The main financial source of the Graduate Program in Language Studies of the UFF comes from the Post-Graduate Program-Proap-CAPES. In the year 2013, this amount is R $ 59,200.00 distributed in 12 quotas.
           With this source, the Post-Graduate Program in Language Studies supports:<br>
          a) The participation of members from outside the state of Rio de Janeiro in the thesis defense thesis;<br>
          b) The participation of occasional collaborators, visiting professors from Brazil and abroad, with a view to the realization of mini-courses, conferences and other academic events (each line of research evemtps and a mini-course with this support);<br>
          c) The participation of teachers of the Program in a national event of the area, with passages or daily (the Program supports, preferably with airfare, all teachers, except those who have a grant from CNPq, in a national event per year);
          <br>d) The participation of students of the Program in a national event of the area, with road and lodging (each advisor indicates one student per year, master's or doctorate);
          <br>e) The publication of works contemplated in the Edict of the Ensaios Collection, destined to the dissemination of results of research of teachers and students of the Program;
          <br>f) The payment of service providers, with a view to maintaining the program page and other technical works, such as editorial review, typing, among others;
